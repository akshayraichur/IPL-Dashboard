## IPL - Dashboard

#### List of all the frameworks / Libraries used :

```
1. React -> I have been working with React for around a year now, and I am very much comfortable using it in building UIs.
2. Chartjs -> Whenever I need to work on data visualisation or building charts, Chartjs comes to my mind instantly, and its very easy to plugin and use.
3. Material UI -> One of my favourite design libraries to build elegant UI.
```

#### Bonus Points :

```
1. PWA -> React Gives us the option to convert a normal website into pwa, it had added serviceworkers and we have to register it.
2. Mobile Responsive -> Material UI is focused on Mobile First design, and it gave me alot of options to make the site responsive.
3. Optimized Loading Time. -> By Using React Hooks, we can achieve better performance out of the box.
